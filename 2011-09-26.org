#+TITLE: A geometric moduli space classifying $D^b(X)$
#+SUBTITLE: Classifying Stack for the Bounded Derived Category
- Parker Laurie

* Example
$X$ is a proper variety over a ring $R$.

Important invariant: Gromov-Witten invariants

These "count" the number of embeddings of $C\xrightarrow{\eta} X$ where $C$
is a smooth curve.

*HARD*

Alternative approach to these invariants:
- "count" $\eta_*\mathscr {O_C}\in Coh(X)$
  - really things that looklike $\eta_*\mathscr {O_C}$.
  - how: Find a *stability condition* that cuts these sheaves out of
    the space $M_{Coh(X)}$.

- $M_{Coh(X)}$ is the moduli stack classifying coherent sheaves.
- Lying: this counting happens in $D^b(X)\contains Coh(X)$.

1) We have no "space" to cut interesting spaces out of.
2) We really want to be able to handle all objects of $D^b(X)$.

* Moduli Space
$Coh(X)$
- if $X=Spec(R)$ then $Coh(X)\equiv R-mod$. (finite-type)
- abelian category

Want classifying stack for $Coh(X)$.
Want a space $M_{Coh(X)}$ satisfying
1) $\{p\subset M_{Coh(X)}\text{ closed}\}$ should correspond to
   objects in $Coh(X)$ (actually $Iso(Coh(X))$)
   - To give topology, define $Hom(Y,M_{Coh(X)}\coloneqq Iso(\{N\in
     Coh(X\times Y) | N\text{ is flat over }Y\}$
   - Gives a functor from $Sch_X\rightarrow \text{Groupoids}$
   - $M_{Coh(X)}(Y)\mapsto Iso(Coh_{fl}(X\times Y)$
   - Well known: $X$ is proper then $M_{Coh(X)}$ is a locally finite
     type Artin stack.


** Example
$Pic(X)\subset M_{Coh(X)}$ classifies line bundles on $X$
- Let $L$ be a line bundle on $X\times Y$. So $L$ is in
  $M_{Coh(X)}(Y)$.
  - Let $p\in Y$ closed, then $L|_{X\times p}$ is a line bundle on $X$.

$QCoh(X)$, $Ch_{QCoh(X)}$
$D(X)$ obtained by formally inverting chain maps that induce
isomorphisms on cohomology, i.e. collapse by objects that "should" be
zero.

** Can we find $M_{D(X)}$?
- Gigantic
- K-theory (waldhausen) $K(Vb(X))$  <--- cohomology
- G-theory: $K(Coh(X))$  <--- homology

If $X$ is smooth, $K(X)=G(X)$.

- $Perf(X)\subset D(X)$ is the smallest subcategory generated by $Vb(X)$
through shifts and extensions
- $D^b(X)\subset D(X)$ is the corresponding closure of $Coh(X)$.

Typical examples:
- Let $p\in X$ smooth point. Then
  $(I_p\rightarrow\mathscr O_X)\equiv K(p)$ (sky-scrapper sheaf)
- Bound chain complexes of vector bundles (resp. coherent sheaves)

$Perf(X)$ only sees smoothness in $X$.

Can we find $M_{D^b(X)}$?

- $D^b(X)$ doesn't have finite limits or colimits
- $D^b(X)$ is the "homotopy" category of some $\infinity$-category
  (or $dg$-category)
  - Exists a simplicial category $\tilde{D^{b}(X)}$ where all
    $Hom(C,D)\coloneqq Map(C,D)$ are kan complexes.
  - Depending on $X$ we can find a model category inducing this
    simplicial category.

Can we find $M_{\tilde{D^b(X)}}$?
- Yes
- $Coh(X)$ ---> $M_{Coh(X)}: Sch \rightarrow Cat \subset Cat_{\Delta}$
- So $M_{\tilde{D^b(X)}}: Sch\rightarrow Cat_{\Delta}$ ($Cat_{\Delta}$
  simplicial category)

- $Cat_\Delta\rightarrow Set_\Delta$ simplicial nerve

- Under this map, $M_{Coh(X)}: Sch \rightarrow\text{2-truncated
  spaces}$.

- $N(Coh(X)\superset N(Iso(X))$

  - $N(Iso(X))$ is the largest Kan complex in $N(Coh(X))$.
- $M_{D^b(X)}(Y)\coloneq\text{largest Kan complex}\subset
  N(D^(b(X\times Y))$ (write $Iso(D^b(X\times Y))$)
- Still not right object (need flatness condition)

Definition: *Relative Tor amplitude*
- Turns out that $D(X)$ is a symmetric monoidal category, using an
  extension of $\otimes$ on modules
- If $f:X\rightarrow Y$, $M\in D^b(X)$, $M$ is said to have
  *finite relative Tor amplitude* if for any $N\in D(X)$ with
  $H^i(N)=0$ for $i\ne0$, then $M\otimes f^*(N)$ has non-zero
  cohomology between $[a,b]$ where $a$ and $b$ depend only on $M$.
- Example: $M$ is flat over $Y$ if $[a,b]=[0,0]$.
- Denote $D^b_{tor}(X\times Y)$ full subet of objects with finite
  relative Tor amplitude

$M_{D^b(X)}(Y)=Iso(D^b_{tor}(X\times Y))$

- What one shows is that $M_{D^b(X)}$ is a stack

Theorem: $M_{D^b(X)}$ is locally geometric and locally almost finite
type

locally geometric:
- $(M_{D^b(X)})_n$ is open in $M_{D^b(X)}$ and is an artin stack
- $M_{D^b(X)}$ is the union of these
