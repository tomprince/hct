"The concept of flatness is a riddle that comes out of algebra, but which
technically is the answer to many prayers" - D Mumford

Auslander - 1961
- $R$ regular local ring
- $M,N$ finite $R$-module
- Q: What does it say about $M$ and $N$, that $M\otimes_RN$ is
  $R$-torsion free?
- *Theorem* (Auslander)
  - $M$ is $R$-flat iff $M^{\otimes_Rn}$ is $R$-torision free where
    $n=dim R$
  - Remarks
    1) -> obvious
    2) the theorem is sharp, (i.e. there exists $M$ non-$R$-flat such
       that $M,M^{\otimes2},\dotsc,M^{\otimes n-1}$ are torsion-free)
    3) $M^{\otimes_Rd}$ is $R$-torsion free for all $d$ iff
       $M^{\otimes n}$ is $R$-torsion-free.
- Vascancelos Conjecture ('97)
  - $R$ regular ring, $dim R=n$, $A=R-alg$ of finite type.
  - then $A$ is $R$-flat iff $A^{\otimes_Rn}$ is $R$-torsion-free
- Q: What does it mean (geometrically) about $\phi:X\rightarrow Y$
  that $\mathscr{O}_{X,\xi}$ has
